# Cpp Features
Small repo to test out cpp features. I am familiar with some of the c++11 features, but I want to play the different standards of the language.
This repo is going to contain my attempts.

[GCC C++ Status](https://gcc.gnu.org/projects/cxx-status.html)

[Visual Studio C++ Status](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/visual-cpp-language-conformance)

I am going to focus on Visual Studio 2017 for now, since I usually use linux with gcc. When I have time I will come back and test it on gcc and clang.

Todo next
---------
 - [x] Create basic folder structure with app and libs
 - [x] Run in Visual Studio 2017 (using cmake)
 - [x] Implement first features in c++ (because I want to implement a feature)
 - [ ] Make list of features to implement

 Maybe
 -----
 - [ ] Extendthe list to include algorithms I want to implement
 - [ ] Use gtest to structure running the features instead of printing to stdout
